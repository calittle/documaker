	            <h2>Background</h2>
	            <p>Oracle Documaker Enterprise Edition <span class="label label-info">ODEE</span> includes Documaker Interactive <span class="label label-info">DI</span>, a robust, full-featured web application that provides user interactivity for document creation, completion, and approval as well as document preview, auditing, dashboard functionality. DI integrates on the back-end with Documaker Web Services <span class="label label-info">DWS</span> and uses <span class="label label-info">WIPedit</span> browser plugin (ActiveX or NPAPI) to facilitate WYSIWYG document editing. DI uses Oracle ADF for its user interface, which has some specific client requirements for browser support.</p>

	            <p>In some cases, an implementation may have requirements that conflict with DI or its components' requirements, or there may be customizations that can be difficult to achieve in DI. In these cases, it may be advantageous to use a customizable web application with a smaller footprint. <span class="label label-info">WIPapp</span> provides full customizability, in a compact footprint, uses the same back-end services (DWS) and client component (WIPedit plugin) for document editing. WIPapp can be deployed on any JSP 2.5-compliant servlet container. <span id="servletnote" class='label label-default'>NOTE</span> Some of the functionality in the basic WIPapp relies on WebLogic classes. If you deploy WIPapp to a servlet container other than WebLogic, you will need to rewrite these functions.</p>
	            
				    <h2 class="media-heading">Architecture</h2>
				    <p>WIPapp is a single-page JSP application, deployed to a servlet container, e.g. WebLogic. WIPapp includes several servlets which facilitate interaction between the application and the back-end services to perform functions such as retrieve document/resources from Documaker, save document, generate proof PDF, and update document status values, e.g. lock/unlock a WIP transaction. Back-end communication is all performed over HTTP. WIPapp uses client-side Javascript to assist in rendering the UI, providing client-side control, and to communication with the WIPedit plugin, embedded as an <span class="code">&lt;OBJECT&gt;</span> within the WIPapp. The WIPedit plugin communicates with the back-end to dynamically retrieve document resources and to save the document, using HTTP. The following diagram illustrates the general architecture in which WIPapp is deployed, including the servlet container, database, ODEE, and client-side.</p>

	            <h2>Support</h2>
	            <p>First, this application is treated as an <em>implementation</em> of core product, which means the application code is <em>not</em> covered by Oracle Support contracts. The back-end DWS functions with which the application interacts as well as the WIPedit plugin are covered by Oracle Support contracts. If an issue is encountered while deploying or using WIPapp, you as a customer can report the issue to Oracle Support for assistance, however if the problem is determined to be in the application and not core product, you will be referred to Oracle Consulting for assistance.</p>
            
				<h2>Requirements</h2>
				<p>WIPapp has the following server/back-end requirements:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Oracle <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E57338_01/documaker_enterprise_ag.pdf">Documaker Web Services 12.x</a> (Schema version V0) - tested against 12.4</li>
                        <li>Oracle <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E57338_01/docupresentment_book.pdf">Documaker Docupresentment 12.x</a> (uses iDMK_* request types, included with ODEE) - tested against 12.4</li>
                        <li>Oracle <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/weblogic/documentation/index.html">WebLogic 11g Release 1</a> (should work with 11g/12c releases); or any other JSP 2.5-compliant servlet container <a href="#servletnote">*</a> - tested against 10.3.6</li>                         
                        <li><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/downloads/java-ee-sdk-6u3-jdk-6u29-downloads-523388.html">JDK 1.6</a> or newer - tested with 1.6, but should be forward compatible.</li>                                                  
                        <li>For authorization, a security realm that includes one or more groups to map to document editor and document reviewer roles within the application.</li>
                    </ul>
				<p>WIPapp users must adhere to the following client requirements:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Browser compatible with WIPedit plugin (currently Internet Explorer and Firefox)</li>
                        <li>A workstation with the <A href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E57338_01/odWIPEdit12m%20R1%20(12.4.0)%20Readme.html">WIPedit</A>a plugin installed (the plugin installer is delivered with ODEE installers)</li>
                        <li>A workstation which allows use of ActiveX or NPAPI plugins within the browser</li>
                        <li>A PDF reader application (with browser integration), if that functionality is desired.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                <h2>Authentication (SSO)</h2>      
                <p>WIPapp supports Servlet 2.5 specification for authentication. The servlet container is used to provide authentication based on WIPapp and container configuration settings. The servlet container (e.g. WebLogic) is configured to provide authentication against a user repository store. WIPapp is configured to support one or more types of authentication based on implementation requirements. WIPapp ships with <span class="code">BASIC</span> plaintext challenge/response configuration, but supports any container-specific configuration using the <span class="code">&lt;<a href="#auth-method">auth-method</a>&gt;</span> parameter, e.g. <span class="code">DIGEST</span> or <span class="code">CLIENT-CERT</span>. Single Sign-On is supported in this configuration using the <span class="code">CLIENT-CERT</span> configuration. For more information, refer to the WebLogic <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E21764_01/web.1111/e13707/saml.htm#SECMG252">documentation</a> for configuring SSO.</p>
                <p>In practice, when a user accesses the application, the Servlet Container first determines if the user is attempting to access secured content. Secured content is defined by an <span class="code"><a href="#secured-content">&lt;url-pattern&gt;</a></span>. If the user attempts to access secured content, the Servlet Container will challenge the browser for credentials according to the configuration in <span class="code">&lt;<a href="#auth-method">auth-method</a>&gt;</span> as described above.</p>
	            
	            <h2>Secure Transport (SSL)</h2>
	            <p>SSL provides secure communications between the client and the application. SSL is a configuration that must be performed outside of the application and requires domain-specific knowledge, certificate acquisition, and container configuration. The only configuration needed for WIPapp is the level of encryption required, which is then applied by the container. Otherwise, WIPapp does not play a role in the configuration of SSL. Application settings to enable SSL rely on the configuration of the container so that the container can route communications between the client to secure channels. The container also handles client certificate validation and establishment of trust. The application is configured to operate on secure channels using the <a href="#ssl"><span class="code">&lt;transport-guarantee&gt;</span></a> configuration.</p>
	            
				<h2>Delivery</h2>
	            <p>WIPapp is delivered as a Web Application Archive <span class="label label-info">WAR</span> file. The WAR file follows a specific structure as outlined in the Servlet-2.5 specification. Prior to deploying the WAR file to target application servers, it must be configured to the environment. This can be done using various software packages, e.g. 7-zip, which allow direct editing of WAR file contents, or the WAR file can be exploded, edited, then reassembled. Direct editing is the recommended approach to avoid any WAR rebuild errors.</p>
	            
	            <h2>Roles</h2>
	            <p>There are two defined roles for WIPapp application: document preparers and document reviewers. These roles are mapped to one or more groups (a.k.a. principals) in the user repository.</p>	            
	            
            </div>
            <div id="webappsettings" class="row">
                    <h2>Application Settings Reference</h2>
                    <p>WIPapp settings are maintained within two files: <span class="code">web.xml</span> and <span class="code">weblogic.xml</span>. Both of these files are located in the <span class="code">WEB-INF</span> directory which is just off of the root of the application. For maximum flexibility, most of WIPapp's settings have been externalized into the <span class="code">web.xml</span> as <span class="code">&lt;context-param&gt;</span> elements, which contain a <span class="code">&lt;param-name&gt;</span> and a <span class="code">&lt;param-value&gt;</span>.<span class='label label-warning'>NOTE</span> Use caution when editing these files as improper configuration could prevent the application from functioning at all. Be careful using <em>diff</em> tools that do not understand the context of name/value pairs contained within separate nodes.

                                application WebLogic can be reached. If you are
                                using an HTTP frontend that has the WebLogic
                                plugin, you can configure the plugin to forward
                                requests as necessary. Such configuration is
                                beyond the detail of this document.
