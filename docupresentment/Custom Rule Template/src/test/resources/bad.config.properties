# You can use this properties file to load in settings for your custom rule.
# or, you can use the arguments string in the implementation of the rule in
# docserv.xml. It is recommended to exclude securables such as passwords from
# the docserv.xml, so you implement strict security on the properties file, and
# the JAR file that it contains. A best-case scenario would be to encrypt the
# password in the properties file and decrypt as needed.
